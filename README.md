# Python_Connectivity

This repository contains the equivalent implementation of the NeuroAlgo functional connectivity code for usage in Python

The implemented measures of functional connectivity are:

- wPlI (weighted phase lag index Vinck et all 2011)
- dPLI (directed phase lag index Stam et all 2012)
- AEC (amplitude envelope correlation)

Other features:

- Surrogate analysis for wPLI and dPLI

An example for every measure can be found here:
`Example_connectivity.ipynb`
