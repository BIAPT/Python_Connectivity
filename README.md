# Python_Connectivity
This repository contains the equivalent implementation of the NEURALGO functional connectivity code for usage in Python 

The implemented measures of functional connectivity are:
- wPli (weighted phase lag index Vinck et all 20??)
- dPLI (directed phase lag index Stam et all 2012)
- AEC (amplitude envelope correlation)

Other features
- surrogate analysis 

An example for every measure can be found here:
Example_analysis.py
 (maybe a notebook might be better here)

You can use the same example data as provided here :
